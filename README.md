android-ogles2-engine
=====================

This is a simple OpenGL|ES 2.0 engine for Android (tested on Android 3.0 or higher). It is primarily intended for rendering phong shaded normal-mapped meshes, e.g. for augmented reality applications.

Implementation includes a curtain and blind model and a particle-based material physics engine.
